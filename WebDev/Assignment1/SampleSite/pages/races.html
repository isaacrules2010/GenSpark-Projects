        <h2>Races of the world</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        There are a number of different kinds of people you may run into and interact with while exploring this world!
    </p>
    <p>
        These peoples can be mostly sorted into two groups, from which they diverge further into their own respective races...
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 20px;">
        <h4>The races of Men are those that are descended from the Humans of Old. Who fought in the great war and won.</h4>
        <div class="RaceDesc">
            The Humans
                <li>
                    These humans are nearly identical, if a bit shorter lived, to their ancient counterparts, though their diversity still FAR outmatches that of other races.
                    Their penchant for exploration and ingenuity mean that they can live just about anywhere in the habitable world (and even some more... dangerous locales)
                </li>
        </div>
        <div class="RaceDesc">
            The Gnomes
            <li>
                A sad tale, really... The gnomes are descended from those ancient mages that bested the mystical creatures at their own games.
                As they were departing for their respective newly forming planes, the Fey Court "gifted" the mages with Fey magic,
                but cursed them to be forever small and live between the cracks of society. Gnomes are rarely seen, but they are crafty,
                and will always find a way to get what they want.
                <p>
                    Though the war ended an age ago, and magic has all but left the world as we know it,
                    gnomes have retained a modicum of their ancestors gifts, both natural and fey in nature,
                    and can use these abilities to see in the dark, speak with small beasts, or sometimes even blend in with their surroundings.
                </p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class="RaceDesc">
            The Halflings
            <li>
                The Halflings are what happens when you leave a bunch of humans and a bunch of gnomes in the same place for an age or two.
                <p>Halfings are a hybrid "race" of Humans and Gnomes, and as such, have inhertited some traits from both.</p>
                <p>Though halflings are technically half-human, they are often even shorter than their Gnomish brethren, and some scholars
                    theorize this to be a secondary effect of the Fey curse. This is widely debated and no consensus has wholly developed on
                    the topic.
                </p>
                <p>Halflings, however, have inherited some of their gnomish parentage's magics, becoming insanely lucky, and because of this,
                    you will find halflings in many occupations that may require a bit of extra luck, either to survive or to make an extra buck.
                    In some circles, it is even viewed as a bad business move to not have at least one Halfling on your team.

    <p style="margin: 20px;">
        <h4>The races of Elves are those that are descended from those ArchFey that decided to stay on the material plane for one reason or the other.</h4>
        These ArchFey had to become something new, however, in order to adapt to the new, magicless world that was being formed as their compatriots left. As such, 
        each became two, who then birthed their respective races.
        <p>Because the elven races are essentially their progenitor's souls split, each race's individual power wanes with each new birth that doesnt have a corresponding death</p>
        <div class="RaceDesc">
            The Pale Elves
            <li>
                The Pale Elves are descended from Vicerni, the once Queen of the Sky Court, who decided to stay within the left-behind world,
                create an island in the middle of the sea... and observe. She wanted to see what the races of man would do with the world they'd won, and
                swore, for good or ill, that her and her descendants would never intervene in teir affairs ever again.
                <p>When she became two, they were gifted with a shared memory, so that all of thei rfindings could be remembered and recorded forever.</p>
                <p>Due to the limited space on their island, and their desire to remain as close to their ancient divine roots as possible, 
                    Pale elf population is the lowest of all the mortal races.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class="RaceDesc">
            The Protector Elves
            <li>
                The Protector Elves are descended from Titan, the once King of the Court of Flowers, who decided to stay and protect a remnant of the world before, 
                known only as the green.
                <p>Originally, when he became two, their descendants were each gifted with powerful plant controlling abilities, but over the centuries, their number has grown too large,
                    and they have retained very little of that former glory. Instead, they now have an ability to naturally blend in with their surroundings, making them harder to detect if they are surrounded
                    by plant life and other "natural" detritus
                </p>
